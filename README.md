## Code
### Create master List
- Run python create_master_list.py
- It will merge all the lists and create an unique list with source details. Called [MASTER_LIST.csv](https://github.com/thejeshgn/blocked/blob/master/MASTER_LIST.csv)
- I plan to add other features and hence a script to merge. 


### Install dependencies
`git clone https://github.com/thejeshgn/blocked`
